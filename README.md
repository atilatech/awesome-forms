# awesome-forms
A collection of resources to make creating forms in your web app easier.

## awesome-forms-values
We've all been there before. You want to add a commonly asked question to your web app form, for example, ["What is your academic major?"](https://github.com/atilatech/awesome-forms/blob/master/awesome-forms-values/data/majors/majors.json) or "Select your [Dietary Preference](https://github.com/atilatech/awesome-forms/blob/master/awesome-forms-values/data/dietary/dietary.json)". However, you don't want to manually add every single option. Use these data sources to  automatically create the options for your forms.


**Protip:** You can Use [jqplay](https://jqplay.org/#) to filter the json files.

E.g. To get the list of only Canadian Schools, enter:
`map(select(.country=="Canada"))` [Snippet](https://jqplay.org/s/mL-eA6ZJlI)
